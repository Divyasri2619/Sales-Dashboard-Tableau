# ðŸ“Š Sales Performance Dashboard

## ðŸ“– Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design an interactive **Tableau dashboard** that provides clear insights into sales performance. It helps analyze sales, profit, and quantity trends while comparing results across time, products, and regions.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Tableau** â€“ Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel / CSV** â€“ Source data format

## ðŸ“Š Data Source
The dataset contains customer details, order transactions, product categories, and regional information, enabling a multi-dimensional view of sales performance.

## ðŸ’¼ Business Problem
Sales data was available at a granular level with information on customers, products, orders, and locations. However, it was difficult to evaluate performance across years, identify profitable and underperforming product subcategories, and track sales trends at both monthly and weekly levels. Without a structured view, comparing key metrics such as sales, profit, and quantity remained unclear.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal of the Dashboard
To build an interactive Tableau dashboard that:
- Summarizes yearly and monthly sales performance.
- Compares sales and profit by product subcategories.
- Tracks weekly trends against averages.
- Visualizes key KPIs across time, products, and regions.

## ðŸš€ Dashboard Features
The dashboard brings together multiple perspectives of sales data into a single interactive view. It includes:
- **KPI Overview**: A high-level snapshot of yearly sales, profit, and quantity with side-by-side comparison of current and previous year.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly performance of sales, profit, and quantity, highlighting peak and low-performing months for quick recognition of patterns.
- **Product Subcategory Analysis**: Comparative view of subcategories across years, showing how sales and profit vary within product groups.
- **Weekly Performance**: Detailed weekly trends with average benchmarks, where weeks performing above or below average are clearly highlighted.

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact & Insights
- **Improved Performance Visibility**: Clear visuals to monitor sales, profit, and quantity trends.
- **Faster Decision-Making**: Year-over-year and monthly comparisons highlight growth patterns and performance gaps quickly.
- **Product Strategy Insights**: Subcategory analysis reveals top-performing and underperforming products.
- **Operational Awareness**: Weekly benchmarking pinpoints strong and weak periods for timely action.
